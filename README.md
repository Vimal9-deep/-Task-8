# -Task-8  
This is another task given by my instructor  
In this task i had learned that how to create a interactive Dashboard that shows sales performance by product, region, and month for a given dataset used.  
Dataset used :- Sample-Superstore (contains the details of sales and their performance).It is in the form of excel file  
Tools used:- Power Bi  
Here, I works on following points:-  
 1. Import the CSV file into Power BI  
 2. Convert Order Date to ‚ÄúMonth-Year‚Äù format  
 3. Add some visuals:  
         Line Chart: Sales over Months. Sorting this chart by date  
         Bar Chart: Sales by Region  
         Donut Chart: Sales by Category  
4.  Adding Filter/Slicer: This allows dynamic filtering of visuals by the selected category
   
üîπ What is  "slicer"?  
   A slicer is an interactive filter that lets users choose values (like Region or Category) to dynamically update your visuals.  
   Like suppose if a stakeholder selects "Technology" in the slicer, your line, bar, and donut charts will all show only Technology category data.  
   
6. Use of Colors to Highlight Top Performing Areas : Use colors to differentiate categories  
7. Writing a Short Insights which are described in seperate text files  

   üîπ What Are "Insights"?  
Insights are observations or conclusions we derive from our dashboard visuals. We are answering questions like:  

What‚Äôs performing well?  

What‚Äôs underperforming?  

Are there any patterns over time?  

Any comparisons worth noting?
